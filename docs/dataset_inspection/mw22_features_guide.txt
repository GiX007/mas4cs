MULTIWOZ 2.2 FEATURES GUIDE FOR MAS4CS
============================================================

This guide explains which dataset features we are going to use and how.
Focus: Building agents that understand, track, and respond to user requests.
This is an initial estimate. During implementation, we re-consider our options.

============================================================
DATASET OVERVIEW
============================================================
MultiWOZ 2.2 contains 8437 training dialogues about:
  - Hotels, Restaurants, Trains, Taxis, Attractions
  - Average 13.5 turns per conversation
  - Multi-domain conversations (users can switch between services)

============================================================
9 CORE FEATURES WE USE
============================================================
1. dialogue_id
   What: Unique name for each conversation
   Example: 'PMUL4398.json'
   How we use it: Track which conversation we're processing

2. turn_id
   What: Order of turn in conversation
   Example: ['0', '1', '2']
   How we use it: Keep conversation in correct order

3. services
   What: Which domains are involved (hotel, restaurant, etc.)
   Example: ['restaurant', 'hotel']
   How we use it: Detect and Validate the correct domain

4. speaker + utterance
   What: Who said what (USER or SYSTEM)
   Example speaker: USER
   Example utterance: 'i need a place to dine in the center thats expensive'
   How we use it: Understand what user wants and generate appropriate responses and actions

5. active_intent
   What: What task the user wants to do
   Example: 'find_restaurant'
   How we use it: Decide which route to follow (e.g., action or policy) and also Validate intent detection

6. requested_slots
   What: Information the user asks for
   Example: ['hotel-phone', 'hotel-address']
   How we use it: Know what info to provide in response

7. slots_values
   What: User's specific requirements (the belief state)
   Example: {'restaurant-area': ['centre'], 'restaurant-pricerange': ['expensive']}
   How we use it: Validate our predictions for hotels/restaurants matching these criteria

8. act_type (dialogue_acts)
   What: Type of action being performed
   Example: 'Restaurant-Inform'
   How we use it: Validate we're doing the right type of action

9. act_slots (dialogue_acts)
   What: Which slot-value pairs go with the action
   Example: slot='area', value='centre'
   How we use it: Ensure we extracted the right information

============================================================
EXAMPLES OF HOW THESE MAY CONNECT TO EVALUATION
============================================================
slots_values → Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA)
  Did we track all user requirements correctly?

active_intent + act_type → Task Success Rate (One point of view)
  Did we complete the right task?

requested_slots + act_slots → Policy Compliance
  Did we ask for required information before booking?
