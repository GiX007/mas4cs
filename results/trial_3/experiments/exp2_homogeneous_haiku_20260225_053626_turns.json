Many upscale Chinese restaurants offer these types of reservations.\n- You could also try contacting some of the higher-end Chinese restaurants in your area directly and inquiring about availability for a group of 4 on Monday at 1pm.\n- When you find a few options, be sure to ask about their pricing and whether they can accommodate your requested date and time.\n\nPlease let me know if you have a specific city or area in mind, and I'd be happy to try to provide some more tailored suggestions.
