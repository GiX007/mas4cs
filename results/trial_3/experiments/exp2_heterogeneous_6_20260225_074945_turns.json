But if the restaurant is located in the centre of town, that narrows it down a bit. Some general tips I can provide:\n\n- Look for highly rated steakhouses or classic American cuisine restaurants in the downtown/city centre area. These often fit the criteria of being traditional American, fine dining, and expensive.\n- You could also search for restaurants with Michelin stars or other prestigious culinary awards, as those tend to be high-end and expensive.\n- I'd suggest checking reviews on sites like OpenTable or Yelp to find highly rated options in the city centre that match what you're looking for.\n\nLet me know if you have any other preferences or a specific area in the centre of town in mind, and I'd be happy to try to provide some more tailored suggestions.

It's a highly rated 4-star hotel that offers complimentary WiFi and is known to have reasonable nightly rates.\n\nAnother possibility is the Marriott Waterfront in Baltimore, Maryland. This 4-star hotel overlooks the harbor and also provides free WiFi access.\n\nThose are just a couple ideas to consider, but without a more specific location from you, I can't provide a tailored recommendation.

They serve a range of modern European dishes in a casual, traditional setting. The prices are generally in the moderate range.\n\nAnother option is Cotto. This restaurant focuses on seasonal, locally-sourced ingredients prepared in a modern European style. The atmosphere is relaxed and the prices are reasonable.\n\nLet me know if either of those sound appealing, or if you'd like me to look into any other modern European restaurants in the moderate price range in Cambridge. I'm happy to provide more details on the options that best fit your needs.",
