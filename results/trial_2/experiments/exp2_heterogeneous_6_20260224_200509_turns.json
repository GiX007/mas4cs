Since you mentioned you're open to Italian restaurants in the north Cambridge area, let me provide a few recommendations for affordable Italian dining options in that vicinity:\n\n- Bella Pasta is a highly rated casual Italian restaurant known for its homemade pastas, pizzas and classic Italian dishes at reasonable prices. It's located just a few miles north of the city center.\n\n- Trattoria Romana is another popular choice, offering an extensive menu of authentic Italian cuisine in a cozy, family-friendly atmosphere. It's situated a bit further north, about 5 miles from the city center.\n\nWould either of those Italian restaurant options in the north Cambridge area work for you?
